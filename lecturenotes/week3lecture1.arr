   the full design recipe
   four steps: do them in this order, and write the code last
   1. type annotation- ex. temp-in-C :: Number) -> String:
   2. docstring: one sentence saying what it is for
   3. examples: concrete input.output pairs in a where: block
   4. code:
|#

# if/else and ask expressions

# if x == 0:
#   1
# else if x > 0:
#   x * 2
# else:
#   x * -1
# end

# # ask expression
# # ask:
# #   | x == 0 then: 1
# #   | x > 0 then: x * 2
# #   | otherwise: * -1
# # end
